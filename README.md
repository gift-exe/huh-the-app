Have you ever been reading a book, or any text material, and then you see a word you are not quite familiar with?  
Do you consider the process of going online to search for it's meaning to be a pain in the ass?  

You're not alone lol : )  

The good news is, you don't have to anymore, just highlight the word, and get it's meaning right on your screen : )  
It works over all apps ... under normal circumstances atleast  


This is a super simple app, it works, but it's like super basic, so if you'd love any new feature, just lmk, by creating an issue  

Have funnnnn : )
