Have you ever been reading a book, or any text material, and then you see a word you are not quite familiar with?  
Do you consider the process of going online to search for it's meaning to be a pain in the ass?  

You're not alone lol : )  

The good news is, you don't have to anymore, just highlight the word, and get it's meaning right on your screen : )  
It works over all apps ... under normal circumstances atleast  

Have funnnnn : )

## CONTRIBUTIONS

Now for my dear (potential) contributors... I've added a video demo of how the app works.  

![demo](https://github.com/gift-exe/huh-the-app/blob/master/demo.mp4)

Currently, the app should only work on Linux, and I have created the installer for only Debian distros (i.e .deb)

So a great point to start contributing from would be creating releases for Windows and Mac OS

check this ![issue](https://github.com/gift-exe/huh-the-app/issues/1) and this ![one](https://github.com/gift-exe/huh-the-app/issues/2), to get more info.  

This is a super simple app, it works, but it's like super basic, so if you'd love any new feature, just create a new issue, and start working on it :)
